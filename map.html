                <p id="map-paragraphs">Glencoe is a hiker's paradise. The map below shows some of the incredible peaks we think you shouldn't miss when you come to Glencoe.</p>

                <li class="map-list-item">Sgorr na Ciche</li>
                <p id="map-paragraphs">Sitting at a height of 742 meters, Sgorr na Ciche can be easily summited in around 2 hours, but has a steep and unrelenting ascent for the majority of the climb. The start of the route can be found around 500 meters east of Glencoe Village, on the road that runs to the north of the River Coe. The route is well sign posted and will take you up the steep south eastern slopes to the bealach between Sgorr na Ciche and Sgorr nam Fiannaidh. From the bealach, head north east until the path leads you round the northern flanks of the hill, with some minor scrambling to achieve the summit. The views from the summit on a clear day are tremendous. </p>

                <li class="map-list-item">Meall Mor</li>
                <p id="map-paragraphs">Meall Mór is a flat-topped hill with steep slopes, often forgotten amongst the illustrious peaks of Glencoe. Its craggy summit area is a superb viewpoint for its mighty neighbours.</p>

                <li class="map-list-item">Aonach Eagach</li>
                <p id="map-paragraphs">Famed as the narrowest ridge on the British mainland (though Liathach and An Teallach must run it close), the Aonach Eagach gives a thrilling and spectacular traverse for keen and experienced scramblers, linking the Munros of Meall Dearg and Sgòrr nam Fiannaidh. The route is a grade 2/3 scramble, and is included in some climbing guides as a 'Moderate' rock climb; it involves probably the trickiest scrambling on any Walkhighlands route. Ensure you have the necessary skills and experience, choose a dry day (the rocks are slippery when wet) and leave plenty of time to complete the route in daylight. If in any doubt, it is best to hire a guide.</p>

                <li class="map-list-item">Three Sisters of Glencoe</li>
                <p id="map-paragraphs">So named for the three distinctive ridges on the Bidean Nam Bian Mountain, the Three Sisters are the most photographed landmark in Glencoe. Rising up from lush, green valleys, the peaks are road-facing and best seen on foot, where you can take in the full majesty of the region’s much beloved natural landmark.</p>

                <li class="map-list-item">Bidean Nam Bian</li>
                <p id="map-paragraphs">The highest mountain in the old county of Argyll, Bidean nam Bian is the whole majestic range of mountains on the south side of Glen Coe. It's dramatic northern ridges are known as the Three Sisters, whilst the highest summits of the group are hidden away behind.</p>

                <li class="map-list-item">Stob Coire Sgreamhach</li>
                <p id="map-paragraphs">Stob Coire Sgreamhach is really part of the Bidean nam Bian massif but become a Munro in its own right in 1997. This fine summit is situated where the Beinn Fhada ridge joins the main ridge across the back of Bidean. Beinn Fhada is tricky terrain - particularly in descent - and the Lost Valley is the route usually used, involving a steep and eroded climb up scree.</p>
